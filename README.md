# Valentine's Day Website

A simple, romantic single-page site for Valentine's Day. Open `index.html` in your browser to view it.

## How to customize

### 1. Text and messages
- Edit **index.html** and change:
  - **Hero**: Update "To my love" and the main title if you want.
  - **Why I love you**: Edit the three message cards and the **custom-message** paragraph.
  - **Letter**: Replace the letter content and signature with your own words.

### 2. Add your photos
- Put your images in the **images** folder (e.g. `photo1.jpg`, `photo2.jpg`).
- In **index.html**, find the gallery section and set each `src` to your file, e.g. `images/photo1.jpg`.
- Change each **gallery-caption** to the caption you want for that photo.

### 3. Run locally
- Double-click **index.html** to open in your browser, or
- Use a simple server (e.g. VS Code Live Server) if you prefer.

No build step or install required—just edit the files and refresh.
